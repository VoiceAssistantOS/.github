# Welcome to VoiceAssistantOS

Voice Assistant OS is a Debian based Linux Operating System for converting a single board computer like a Raspberry Pi into a local voice assistant! (Planned) Features include entirely local control, music playback on-device, smart home integrations, custom skills, and more! 

Currently this project hasn't been released yet, but check back later for updates and releases!

For documentation, see [the documentaion repository](https://github.com/VoiceAssistantOS/docs), for releases see [the main repository](https://github.com/github.com/VoiceAssistantOS/vaOS).

(We have a really good logo right??? I made it with gimp in like 10 minutes lol)
